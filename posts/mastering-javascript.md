JavaScript powers the web - it's **the** most important programming language you need to know as a web developer.

I have been taking a deep dive into it for months and am finally getting comfortable with the ins and outs of the language

So far the experience has been great and I love how JavaScript brings my web applications to life!

### Till Next Time Have A Great Day and Happy Coding Everyone!
