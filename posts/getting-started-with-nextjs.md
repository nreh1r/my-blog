NextJS is a **framework for ReactJS**.

Wait a second ... a "framework" for React? Isn't React itself already a framework for JavaScript?

Well ... first of all, React is a "library" for JavaScript. That seems to be important for some people.

Not for me, but still, there is a valid point: React already is a framework / library for JavaScript. So it's already an extra layer on top of JS.

## Why would we then need NextJS?

Because NextJS makes building React apps easier - especially React apps that should have server-side rendering (though it does way more than just take care of that).

In this article, I'll talk about a few of the core concepts and features, I have learned so far, thatNextJS offers that I find simplify development:

-   File-based Routing
-   Built-in Page Pre-rendering

## File-based Routing

The ability to make page routes without boiler plate React Router code drastically simplifies a project for me. The code also flows better in my mind when I am trying to think how to connect pages together to create a full website.

## Built-in Page Pre-rendering

To me this is another one of the huge step ups over a traditional React app that makes NextJS far superior. Being able to have pre rendered content that is visible to search engine bots to read is crucial in todays world. NextJS creates a simple, yet elegant, way of doing this through getStaticProps.

There is more I have yet to dive into on server side rendering but from what I have learned so far I cannot wait to dive in further!

### Till Next Time Have A Great Day and Happy Coding Everyone!
